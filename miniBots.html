									<h3 class="major">Purpose</h3>
									<p>
										Minibots is a project that is hosted by Schulich Makerspace, where you build a remote controlled car and learn how to use hand tools along the way.
										This is permote students learning via hands on experience outside of classes and expand their knowledge using things that intrest them.
										My role was to figure out how to connect to the nRF24L01 bluetooth module with another nRF module and communicate back and forth between them.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">The Bot</h3>
									<p>

									</p>
									<p>
										The bot itself is made of a wooden frame, using 2 DC motors, a L298n motor driver, arduino Nano, 3 Li-ion batteries, and a nRF24L01 for wireless communication.
										The motor driver connected to the two motors, which had 3 inputs per motor, enable, in1, in2. enable simultaenously controlled if the motor was on and the speed using PWM.
										in1 and 2 determined which direction the motor would spin once, repeat this for the other motor and you have a total of 6 inputs on the driver.
										These inputs were supplied by the Arduino, which did the logic to determine which directions the motors should be spinning.
										The Arudino got its input from the nRF module which connected to another set of Arduino and nRF and a controller, the transmitter would send how fast each motor should spin and in what direction.
										The controller has 2 double pull switches which controlled direction (up forward, middle off, and down backwards) and 2 potensiometer which controlled speed of the motors.
									</p>

									<p>
										After building a sucsessful prototype was built and the software bugs were worked out, I wrote a guide on how to copy the work i've done and create their own versions.
										This guide, which can be found on my github has a detailed explanation on each components and how to set it up and some background information that I beleive useful in trouble shooting components and a general understanding of what the component does.
										
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">What I learned</h3>

									<p>
										This was my first attempt at working with real hardware, for most of my coding life i've only worked on the computer so I have never actually touched any hardware.
										So I spent quite a few hours just learning how to hook everything up so that it wouldn't blow up in my face, overall it wasn't hard just new.
										Working with the chip wasn't too hard as I had access to Libraries that ended up doing most of the registers for me, which allowed me to create my own protocol and send that to the other chip.
										After a working prototype was working I got my own bot and mounted what i've learned on to it, and after many hours of tweeting later, the video above shows the results.
										Overall I wouldn't say I learned many technical aspects, i've barely broken the surface on what is out there, but a few things i've learned where...
									</p>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<ul>
												<li>SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface</li>
												<li>H Bridges</li>
												<li>Arduinos (nano)</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>

									<p>
										By no means am I saying I know these well, but I now have experience with using these tools and I'm currently working on expanding on what I know with two other projects.
										First is connecting my phone via bluetooth to one of the nRF chips, I found code online that can connect it to my phone but it's limited because it only acts as an advertiser,
										and since it's not library and is actually using SPI to talk to the chip, i've read the data sheet am learning how to set the registers in a way where I could connect my phone.
										Currently at the time of writing this, the project is on hold as I wait to get Arduinos to experament with as the ones I had are on miniBots. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The second project is the robotic arm for the University of Calgary Rover Team, Where we are using the L298n motor driver to driver steppermotors, which control the axis of the arm.
										We intend not to use libraries for this purpose as we are trying to learn as much as we can, so using a library is counter productive. 
										Addtionally for a project like this we would want as much control as possible, so writting our own libraries would be more benifical to us.
